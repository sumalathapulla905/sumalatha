**Cloud computing** provides a modern alternative
to the traditional on-premises datacenter. A
public cloud vendor is completely responsible
for hardware purchase and maintenance and
provides a wide variety of platform services that
you can use. You lease whatever hardware and
software services you require on an as-needed
basis, thereby converting what had been a
capital expense for hardware purchase into an
operational expense. It also allows you to lease
access to hardware and software resources that
would be too expensive to purchase. Although
you are limited to the hardware provided by the
cloud vendor, you only have to pay for it when
you use it. 

Cloud environments provide an online portal
experience, making it easy for users to manage
compute, storage, network, and application
resources. For example, in the Azure portal, a
user can create a virtual machine (VM)
configuration specifying the following: the VM
size (with regard to CPU, RAM, and local disks),
the operating system, any predeployed software,
the network configuration, and the location of
the VM. The user then can deploy the VM based
on that configuration and within a few minutes
access the deployed VM. This quick deployment compares favorably with the previous
mechanism for deploying a physical machine,
which could take weeks just for the procurement
cycle.

**Comparison of on-premises versus
Azure**

With an on-premises infrastructure, you have
complete control over the hardware and
software that you deploy. Historically, this has
led to hardware procurement decisions focused
on scaling up; that is, purchasing a server with
more cores to satisfy a performance need. With
Azure, you can deploy only the hardware
provided by Microsoft. This leads to a focus on
scale-out through the deployment of additional
compute nodes to satisfy a performance need.
Although this has consequences for the design
of an appropriate software architecture, there is
now ample proof that the scale-out of
commodity hardware is significantly more costeffective than scale-up through expensive
hardware.

Microsoft has deployed Azure datacenters in
over 22 regions around the globe from
Melbourne to Amsterdam and Sao Paulo to
Singapore. Additionally, Microsoft has an
arrangement with 21Vianet, making Azure
available in two regions in China. Microsoft has
also announced the deployment of Azure to another eight regions. Only the largest global
enterprises are able to deploy datacenters in this
manner, so using Azure makes it easy for
enterprises of any size to deploy their services
close to their customers, wherever they are in the
world. And you can do that without ever leaving
your office.

For startups, Azure allows you to start with very
low cost and scale rapidly as you gain customers.
You would not face a large up-front capital
investment to create a new VM—or even several
new VMs. The use of cloud computing fits well
with the scale fast, fail fast model of startup
growth.

Azure provides the flexibility to set up
development and test configurations quickly.
These deployments can be scripted, giving you
the ability to spin up a development or test
environment, do the testing, and spin it back
down. This keeps the cost very low, and
maintenance is almost nonexistent.

**Cloud offering**

Cloud computing usually is classified in three
categories: SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS. However, as the
cloud matures, the distinction among these is
being eroded.

**1.SaaS: Software as a service**

SaaS is software that is centrally hosted and
managed for the end customer. It usually is
based on a multitenant architecture—a single
version of the application is used for all
customers. It can be scaled out to multiple
instances to ensure the best performance in all
locations. SaaS software typically is licensed
through a monthly or annual subscription.
Microsoft Office 365 is a prototypical model of a
SaaS offering. Subscribers pay a monthly or
annual subscription fee, and they get Exchange
as a Service (online and/or desktop Outlook),
Storage as a Service (OneDrive), and the rest of
the Microsoft Office Suite (online, the desktop
version, or both). Subscribers are always provided the most recent version. This essentially
allows you to have a Microsoft Exchange server
without having to purchase a server and install
and support Exchange—the Exchange server is
managed for you, including software patches
and updates. Compared to installing and
upgrading Office every year, this is much less
expensive and requires much less effort to keep
updated.

Other examples of SaaS include Dropbox,
WordPress, and Amazon Kindle. 

**2.PaaS: Platform as a service**

With PaaS, you deploy your application into an
application-hosting environment provided by
the cloud service vendor. The developer provides
the application, and the PaaS vendor provides
the ability to deploy and run it. This frees
developers from infrastructure management,
allowing them to focus strictly on development.
Azure provides several PaaS compute offerings,
including the Web Apps feature in Azure App
Service and Azure Cloud Services (web and
worker roles). In either case, developers have
multiple ways to deploy their application without
knowing anything about the nuts and bolts
supporting it. Developers don’t have to create
VMs, use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to log into each one, and install the application. They
just hit a button (or pretty close to it), and the
tools provided by Microsoft provision the VMs
and then deploy and install the application on
them.

**3.IaaS: Infrastructure as a service**

An IaaS cloud vendor runs and manages server
farms running virtualization software, enabling
you to create VMs that run on the vendor’s
infrastructure. Depending on the vendor, you
can create a VM running Windows or Linux and
install anything you want on it. Azure provides
the ability to set up virtual networks, load
balancers, and storage and to use many other
services that run on its infrastructure. You don’t
have control over the hardware or virtualization
software, but you do have control over almost
everything else. In fact, unlike PaaS, you are
completely responsible for it.

Azure Virtual Machines, the Azure IaaS offering,
is a popular choice when migrating services to
Azure because it enables the “lift and shift”
model for migration. You can configure a VM
similar to the infrastructure currently running
your services in your datacenter and migrate
your software to the new VM. You might need to
make tweaks, such as URLs to other services or storage, but many applications can be migrated
in this manner.

Azure VM Scale Sets (VMSS) is built on top of
Azure Virtual Machines and provides an easy
way to deploy clusters of identical VMs. VMSS
also supports autoscaling so that new VMs can
be deployed automatically when required. This
makes VMSS an ideal platform to host higherlevel microservice compute clusters such as for
Azure Service Fabric and the Azure Container
Service.

**Azure services**
Azure includes many services in its cloud
computing platform. Let’s talk about a few of
them.

**1.Compute services**

This includes the Azure
Virtual Machines—both Linux and Windows,
Cloud Services, App Services (Web Apps,
Mobile Apps, Logic Apps, API Apps, and
Function Apps), Batch (for large-scale
parallel and batch compute jobs),
RemoteApp, Service Fabric, and the Azure
Container Service.

**2.Data services** 

This includes Microsoft
Azure Storage (comprised of the Blob,
Queue, Table, and Azure Files services),Azure SQL Database, DocumentDB,
StorSimple, and the Redis Cache.

**3.Application services**

This includes services
that you can use to help build and operate
your applications, such as Azure Active
Directory (Azure AD), Service Bus for
connecting distributed systems, HDInsight
for processing big data, Azure Scheduler,
and Azure Media Services.

**4.Network services** This includes Azure
features such as Virtual Networks,
ExpressRoute, Azure DNS, Azure Traffic
Manager, and the Azure Content Delivery
Network.
